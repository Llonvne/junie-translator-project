Hello, this is a sample subtitle file.
For testing the translation functionality.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The translator should convert this text
to the target language specified in the config.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This will help us verify that the
lock file mechanism works correctly.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And that the output filename includes
the source language, target language, and hash.
